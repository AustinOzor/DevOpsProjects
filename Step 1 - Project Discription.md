### Project Description ###
In this project I implemented a Web-Stack using Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. 
The LAMP web stack is a popular and widely used technology stack for developing and deploying web applications. 
LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, representing the key components of this stack.

### Decription of the components ###
#### Linux ####
is the operating system used as the foundation of the web stack. It provides a stable and secure environment for hosting web applications.
Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian are commonly used in LAMP setups.

#### Apache HTTP Server ####
is the web server software that handles incoming HTTP requests and serves web pages to clients. 
It is a robust and feature-rich server that supports various modules and configurations. Apache is known for its stability, scalability, 
and widespread use in the industry.

#### MySQL ####
is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for storing and managing application data.
It provides a reliable and efficient way to organize and retrieve structured data. MySQL is known for its performance, flexibility, and 
compatibility with different programming languages and platforms.

### PHP ###
is a server-side scripting language that is used for developing dynamic web applications. It allows you to embed PHP code within HTML
pages to generate dynamic content. PHP is known for its ease of use, extensive community support, and compatibility with various databases and frameworks.
